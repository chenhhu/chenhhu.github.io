Broad outline of my research.  
</h6>

<p align="justify">
My research is to study the underlying physics of solid deformation and fluid flow in subsurface porous rocks under hydraulic, mechanical, and chemical loadings by developing advanced mechanical models and the corresponding computational frameworks. My collaboration with Professor Waisman continues after my graduation, and we together analyzed how chemical-reaction-induced solid dissolution influenced the hydromechanical responses and fracture propagation of porous geomaterials as well as the seal integrity of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration reservoirs. My current postdoctoral research focuses on the advanced modeling of coupled fracture and damage in geomechanical materials subjected to a range of multiphysical loading regimes, including hydraulic, thermal, and chemical processes. Ongoing works include involve the development of the theory and implementation of the advanced mechanics and numerical models, as well as constitutive model calibration and validation based on physical experimental data, etc. My career vision is to develop a world-class research group focusing on the multi-phase, multi-scale, and multi-physics processes in the subsurface porous geomaterials spanning a broad geo-engineering application (geo-resources, geo-hazards, and geo-structures).
