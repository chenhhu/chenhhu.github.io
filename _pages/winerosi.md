Offshore floating wind is a key part of the net-zero transition, but blade durability remains a major challenge. Continuous exposure to rain and airborne particles leads to coating erosion, which reduces aerodynamic performance and energy output, accelerates damage, and shortens service life.
</p>
<p align="justify">
At the moment, the industry still spends a huge amount on inspection and maintenance. Rope-access operations, drone inspections, and repeated offshore interventions are expensive, weather-limited, and become increasingly impractical as wind farms move further offshore. This drives up operational costs and affects the reliability of wind energy production.

Importantly, leading-edge erosion is not only a wind energy problem. Similar erosion issues are critical for aircraft structures, steam turbine blades, and other high-speed rotating or aerodynamic components, where surface degradation can significantly impact efficiency, safety, and lifetime.

This project aims to contribute to a better understanding of these challenges and to support more durable designs, helping to reduce maintenance demand, prevent premature failures, and lower lifecycle costs across multiple industries.
