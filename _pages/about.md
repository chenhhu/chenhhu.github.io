<p align="justify"> 
I work on computational geomechanics focused on the coupled hydro-chemo-mechanical processes in subsurface porous rocks. I acquired my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University in September 2021, under the supervision of Professor Ronaldo I. Borja. I was a Shuimu postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University collaborating with Professor Jian-Min Zhang from 2021 to 2024. Now I am a postdoctoral researcher at Northwestern University working with Professor Zdeněk P. Bažant on fracture mechanics and CHM modeling to explore the feasibility of mineral carbon sequestration.

I will be joining the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Hong Kong in the Spring of 2026, and I am actively seeking Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scholars. Interested candidates can send email to me to discuss about these opportunities.
