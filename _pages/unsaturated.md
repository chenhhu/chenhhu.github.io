## Unsaturated porous media problems
<p align="justify">
One of my ongoing work is to cast the dual mechanism failure criterion into the phase-field fracture modeling framework and develop a computational tool for boundary-value problem simulations that involve tensile failure of transversely isotropic rocks[2]. By assigning each failure mechanism a distinct phase-field variable, we can describe failure through rock matrix or along weak bedding planes separately.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
The ensuing figures demonstrate a benchmark test to validate the implementation of the phase-field model, where we tried to reproduce the response of Lyons Sandstone in uniaxial tension test. As one can see in the following figure, tensile crack tends to propagate along the bedding planes (represented by <i>d<sub>1</sub></i>) when the bedding plane orientation is mild, and to propagate through the rock matrix (represented by <i>d<sub>2</sub></i>) when the bedding plane orientation is steep in the specimen.
